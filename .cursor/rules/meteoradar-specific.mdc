## Meteoradar App Specific Rules

### Radar Data Handling

- **USE** `Constants.Radar` for all radar-related configuration
- **USE** `NetworkService.shared` for all network operations
- **CACHE** radar images when appropriate to reduce network usage

### Location Services

- **RESPECT** user privacy - only request location when needed
- **IMPLEMENT** battery-efficient location tracking with appropriate filters
- **USE** `Constants.Location` for location-related configuration

### Services Architecture

- **SEPARATE** concerns: LocationManager for location, RadarImageManager for radar data
- **IMPLEMENT** singleton pattern for shared services (NetworkService)
- **CENTRALIZE** all configuration in Constants.swift
