## Project-Specific Swift Patterns

### Performance Focus

- **MINIMIZE** location updates with appropriate distance filters and time intervals
- **USE** efficient image rendering techniques for map overlays
- **AVOID** unnecessary UI updates in the main thread

### Memory Management for Maps

- **USE** `[weak self]` in location and network closures
- **HANDLE** map overlay cleanup properly
