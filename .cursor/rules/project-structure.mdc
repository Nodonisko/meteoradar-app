## Project Structure

```
App/         # App entry point
Models/      # Data models
Views/       # SwiftUI views
Services/    # Business logic
Utilities/   # Constants & helpers
Resources/   # Assets
```

## Key Rules

- **NEVER** put business logic in Views - use Services instead
- **ALWAYS** use Constants.swift for configuration values
- **FOLLOW** the existing folder structure when adding new files
